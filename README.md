**Group Mission:** We get together with authors from the Causality x AI/ML literature to discuss their papers in a lively group discussion.

**Group Schedule:** We meet weekly on **Wednesday at 10:30 ET** / which is 16:30 CEST/CET in summer/winter / which is 23:30 JST. (Remember your time zones: for example in central Europe from April to October it is CEST (= UTC + 2 hour offset) and from November to March it is CET (= UTC + 1))

**This Code Base:** The official repository of the Causality Discussion Group. As of now, the scraper for the paper list is the only code element of the group. Before running yourself, make sure that the desired parameters are set. For OpenReview scraping, an account with credentials plus `openreview-py` are necessary. Extended support now also covers v2 of OR's API, thus, we have current proceedings of NeurIPS 2023 working as well.
